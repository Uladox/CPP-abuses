# CPP-abuses
How not to write code and do it well!

This file is a detailed set of abuses of the C preprocessor (cpp) that I have written down in hopes of having a general file to test them out :). Have fun with these, and don't just look at them, try them! Use the command:

```
cpp -P cpp_tutorial.h
```

to see what text is generated. I have to give thanks to the following tutorials: [C Pre-Processor Magic](http://jhnet.co.uk/articles/cpp_magic) by Jonathan Heathcote and [C Preprocessor tricks, tips, and idioms](https://github.com/pfultz2/Cloak/wiki/C-Preprocessor-tricks,-tips,-and-idioms) by Paul Fultz II.
